Most complete facial I've ever had. ACTUALLY DOES EXTRACTIONS! And in body contouring I saw 2-3 cm results first session. Definitely recommend the package!

Finding someone who gives facials is easy — but finding a specialist who truly evaluates your skin, understands what it needs, and treats you with genuine care is rare.

I have extremely sensitive skin, and from the moment I walked in, I felt understood and in expert hands. She didn’t just go through the motions — she tailored every step to what my face was missing.

Let me tell you… if you’ve been searching for the right person, you just found her. Highly recommend! 💆‍♀️✨

Carmen's knowledge and care for my skin was amazing. She explained the process well and very good at communicating what she was doing and why. I had a cryotherapy facial which was new for me and I loved it!Very nice and relaxing experience. My skin looks great too!

Alright, so I just had my first facial experience, and honestly, it was amazing. The whole vibe of the place was super relaxing, and the esthetician really knew what she was doing. I mean, I could feel all the tension just melting away as she worked her magic on my skin.

The products she used smelled incredible, and I think my skin has never felt this soft and refreshed. It was all about taking time for myself, and I walked out feeling like a million bucks. Seriously, if you haven’t tried a facial yet, you should totally give it a shot. It’s such a worthwhile experience!

I wholeheartedly recommend Carmen — she is truly exceptional. It was my first time receiving a facial and experiencing such a thorough cleansing treatment, and she guided me through every step with care and clarity. She explained each procedure in detail (what she was doing and why) and remained attentive and kind throughout, always checking in on my comfort and addressing my concerns.
After the treatment, my skin feels absolutely incredible: refreshed, rejuvenated, and visibly clearer. I genuinely feel younger, and I can tell my skin is finally breathing again, completely unclogged. I will definitely be returning, and I encourage everyone to try it. There’s truly no better place and no better person than Carmen for this experience!

She's excellent! Highly recommended! She changed the texture of my skin, which was very thin, and she also made more spots disappear ❤️ I also had a treatment on my buttocks, and it eliminated 95 percent of my cellulite! Do yourself a favor and go; you'll be very happy with her treatments.
